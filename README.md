# Network Proxy (with LFU caching)

This repository contains code for the Project 'Network Proxy with O(1) LFU caching' for the course IT204 - Data Structures and Algorithms. 

The primary objective of the project is to implement the data structure described in []() that allows O(1) runtime for LFU cache operations. We then use this data structure to implement LFU caching in a simple Network Proxy.
