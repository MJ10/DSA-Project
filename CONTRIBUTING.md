## Guidelines
* Avoid using random variable names. Try using meaningful names for variables.
* Follow the PEP-8 style guide, which can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style)
* Add Docstrings to each function you define, detailing the input parameters and the value being returned. Refer [this](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#documentation-strings)
* Annotate all the functions. Refer [this](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#function-annotations)
* As far as possible, try abstracting as much detail as possible. for eg. define getter functions instead of directly accessing values from a class.
